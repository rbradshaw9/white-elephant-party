**Title:** "Operation Santa's Manifest"

**Lyrics:**

```
[Verse 1]
Red alert from the North Pole base
Mission briefing, time to embrace
Santa's list has been compromised  
Agents gather, gifts are the prize

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleigh bells ringing, countdown's on
Wrap it up before the dawn
Secret codes and holiday cheer
The greatest heist of the year

[Chorus]
It's the Great Gift Heist tonight
Stealing presents left and right
White Elephant, oh what a sight
Christmas chaos, pure delight
Operation Santa's Manifest
Put your gift-stealing skills to the test
Jingle all the way to victory
This is our holiday mystery!

[Verse 2]
Undercover in our ugly sweaters
Trading gifts like secret letters
Budget's set at twenty-five to fifty
Keep it fun and keep it thrifty

[Bridge]
HQ calling all field agents
Holiday joy is contagious
Transmissions live from candy cane control
Let the gift exchange unroll

[Final Chorus]
It's the Great Gift Heist tonight
Stealing presents left and right
White Elephant, oh what a sight
Christmas chaos, pure delight
Your codename's ready, mission's clear
Spread the joy and Christmas cheer!

[Outro]
Mission accomplished, presents unwrapped
Memories made, that's a wrap
See you next December, agents stand by
For the greatest gift heist in the sky!
```
