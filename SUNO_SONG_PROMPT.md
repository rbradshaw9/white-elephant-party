**Lyrics:**

```
[Verse 1]
Alert from the North Pole base
Party invitation, time to embrace
Santa's list has been prepared  
Elves are gathering, gifts to be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleigh bells ringing, countdown's on
Wrap it up before the dawn
Elf codenames and holiday cheer
The greatest party of the year

[Chorus]
It's the Great Gift Party tonight
Swapping presents left and right
White Elephant, oh what a sight
Christmas chaos, pure delight
Operation Santa's Manifest
Put your gift-swapping skills to the test
Jingle all the way to victory
This is our holiday mystery!

[Verse 2]
Dressed up in our ugly sweaters
Trading gifts like festive letters
Budget's set at twenty-five to fifty
Keep it fun and keep it thrifty

[Bridge]
North Pole calling all elf agents
Holiday joy is contagious
Transmissions live from candy cane control
Let the gift exchange unroll

[Final Chorus]
It's the Great Gift Party tonight
Swapping presents left and right
White Elephant, oh what a sight
Christmas chaos, pure delight
Your codename's ready, party's clear
Spread the joy and Christmas cheer!

[Outro]
Party accomplished, presents unwrapped
Memories made, that's a wrap
See you next December, elves stand by
For the greatest gift party in the sky!
```
